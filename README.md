# cpp_ticking_system
c++, computer_graphics, ticking system, do experiments to test the performance of distortion.

In the scene of VR (virtual reality),
when compressing a big virtual scene into  real small area,
there is inevitable distortion in some degree, 
so do some test to measure how much acceptance of people towards distortion.
